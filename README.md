# Threveal

**Thread Reveal** — A performance analysis tool for Intel hybrid architectures that tracks thread migrations between Performance (P) and Efficiency (E) cores, correlates migrations with hardware performance counter deltas, and generates actionable affinity optimization recommendations.

## Overview

Intel's 12th-generation (Alder Lake) and subsequent processors introduced a heterogeneous architecture combining high-performance P-cores with power-efficient E-cores. While the Linux scheduler dynamically migrates threads between core types for efficiency, this creates performance unpredictability for HPC workloads.

Threveal aims to fill this visibility gap by providing per-thread migration tracking, PMU correlation, and affinity recommendations.
